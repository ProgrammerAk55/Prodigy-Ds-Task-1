## 📁 Project Overview

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This repo is part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech. I explored World Bank population data using Python and Jupyter Notebook, focusing on long-term trends, decadal growth, and insights from the year 2024.

## 📊 Dataset Details

- Source: World Bank (cleaned version)

- File Name: world_population_dataset.csv

- Years Covered: 1960 – 2023 (with projections for 2024)

- Scope: Includes 216 countries, including small island nations as per UN classification

- Exclusions: Removed aggregate or non-country entries such as:

- High income / Low income

- IDA & IBRD classifications

- HIPC, LDC, HDC, and other economic groupings

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)

- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation

- Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualization

---

## 🔍 EDA Workflow

✔️ Data Loading & Inspection
Viewed sample rows, column names, and dataset shape. Checked for missing values and performed basic statistical summaries.

✔️ Data Cleaning
Removed non-country entries and irrelevant aggregates. Ensured only valid UN-recognized countries were retained.

✔️ Transformation & Aggregation
Calculated population sums by decade (1960s to 2020s) and aggregated data for comparative analysis.

✔️ Visualization
 - Bar chart: India’s population growth across decades

 - Histogram: Population distribution across countries in the 2024

 - Bar chart: Global population growth every 10 years

 - Bar charts: Top 20 and Bottom 20 countries by population in 2024

📈 Key Insights

🌐 The dataset reveals consistent global population growth across decades

🇮🇳 India’s population trend shows significant growth, especially post-2000

📊 Population distribution is highly skewed, with a few countries contributing the majority

📅 In 2024:

Top 20 Countries (e.g., India, China, USA) dominate global population figures

Bottom 20 Countries (e.g., Tuvalu, Nauru, Monaco) highlight the diversity in scale across nations

📈 The Global Population Growth Plot shows how each country’s population evolved every 10 years, offering a comparative view of demographic expansion across regions

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

📊 Compare regional growth rates and demographic shifts

📈 Apply time series forecasting for future population estimates

🔗 Merge with socioeconomic indicators for deeper insights

---

## Conclusion

This EDA task provided a strong foundation for understanding global population dynamics. By cleaning and refining the dataset to include only valid countries, analyzing both extremes of the population spectrum in 2024, and visualizing decadal growth across all nations, the insights are more focused and meaningful. It sets the stage for advanced modeling and policy-relevant exploration.

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
